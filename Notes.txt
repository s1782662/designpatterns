Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced
object oriented software developers.

Design patterns are categorized into three types

1. Creational Design patterns

3. Behavioral Design patterns


Creational Design Patterns
--------------------------
1. Abstract Factory
2. Builder
3. Factory Method
4. Object Pool
5. Prototype
6. Singleton



Abstract Factory

- Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their
concrete classes

- A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible platforms and the construction of a suite of products

- The new operator is considered harmful
